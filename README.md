# Hexforce
Hexcasting Greater Spells Bruteforcing
## How to use this!

*Probably don't*

If you have to, slap down a CC computer, upload hexforce.lua and autohexforce.lua into it. 
Put a focal port adjacent to the computer (outputs the patterns found). 
Use a wired modem to connect as many focal links as you please, one per wisp you plan to use.
Then run `autohexforce`

*A little warning: Some of the lists of possible patterns are incomplete for some reason. If the accursed mechanism gets stuck into a neverending loop and doesn't get itself out in 5 seconds or so, press the terminate button to move onto the next pattern.*

For the wisps themselves, cast the following spell while looking at one of the focal links:
