## How to use this!
Probably don't

If you have to, slap down a CC computer, upload hexforce.lua and autohexforce.lua into it. Put a focal port adjacent to the computer (outputs the patterns found). Use a wired modem to connect as many focal links as you please, one per wisp you plan to use.
For the wisps themselves, cast the following spell while looking at one of the focal links:
